## 🌟 Reflection of the course
This course has taught me a lot about the fundamental knowledge in learning Computer Science. It is undeniably an essential course that needs to be introduced to all first-year students of Computer Science to help them strengthen their fundamental knowledge before diving deeper into the digital world. From this courses, I have learned about the emerging technologies in ICT, get to know the components in hardware and software, both in slides and also in real life during the PC Assemble Lab that allowed me to practice what I have learnt in class into practical activity. Other than that, I have also learnt more in depth about the Information Systems and Methodology, Databases and Data Analystics and also other course program's knowledge such as Networks and Communications, Privacy, Security, and Ethics in computing and last but not least about cloud computing that is also an emerging technology in today's world. What excite me most about this course is the way of teaching my lecturer possessed. Dr Aryati has a variety of fresh and engaging teaching styles to keep the students engrossed in her teaching. Not only that, she always make sure to engage her students in doing presentations, group discussion and also acting as a way of learning instead of just passively listening to her lectures. Overall, I picked up a lot of useful new knowledges from this course, it has enhanced my creativity, criticial thinking, polished my team-working skills and strengthen my overall soft skills that promotes my self and professional growth.
