# Project: Design Thinking
## 🏢 Details
For our first Technology & Information System project, we were tasked to apply the process of design thinking into creating a solution for a real-world problem. After that, we are required to present our findings into a demostration **video**, full **report** and **present** it during class session. <br>

## ⏳ Chronology
**Our problem statement:** <br>
Our group worked on the theme “Smart Campus Data Solution: Improving Student Experience through Data.” After discussions and brainstorming, we identified that many study areas on campus are overcrowded during peak hours. Students also find it difficult to locate study spaces that match their needs, such as quiet areas for individual study or discussion spaces for group work. Therefore, our goal is to develop a solution that helps students easily find suitable study spaces and improves the overall use of study areas at UTM. <br>
*We conducted our project through 5 stages in the design thinking process*
- **Stage 1:** Emphathy <br>
We created a Google Form and conducted interviews to collect students’ opinions and experiences when searching for study spaces. The questions focused on their awareness of available study spaces, study preferences, and behavior during peak hours. This helped us understand students’ real needs and challenges.
- **Stage 2:** Define <br>
From the survey results, we found that students often struggle to find seats, especially during peak hours. Many study areas are too noisy, making it hard to concentrate. Students also tend to leave early when spaces become overcrowded or uncomfortable. Based on these findings, we developed a clear problem statement to guide the next stage of the project.
- **Stage 3:** Ideate <br>
With a clear problem identified, we conducted a brainstorming session where all members shared ideas. We decided to design a feature that displays a list of study spaces across campus along with their occupancy levels. The solution also includes filters to help students find spaces based on their preferences, as well as detailed information such as seating capacity.
- **Stage 4:** Prototype <br>
We created a low-fidelity prototype by sketching the interface to demonstrate how the solution would work. We also created the prototype in Canva to show a more visualised and clearer version of it. The prototype focused on meeting users’ needs and improving study space utilization.
- **Stage 5:** Testing <br>
We tested the prototype by inviting students to try it and provide feedback. Their responses helped us identify what worked well and what needed improvement. Based on the feedback, we refined the prototype to better meet users’ needs.

## 📝 Reflections
This design thinking project has helped me gain a clearer understanding of how to successfully manage a project by using a real-world problem. Going through different phases allowed me to better understand the issue and design an effective solution. The project also strengthened my critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, which are essential for my future career. Overall, I wish to apply everything that I had learned while making this project into future projects and assignments that I will be doing.
