## 💡 Summary
This lab session gives students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in disassembling and assembling a PC. It started off with the briefing session by the staff on how to handle each components, starting from removing the wires, power supply, RAM, hard disk, and the cooling fan at last. The students were also divided into several small groups to ensure everyone will be able to experience it. After successfully disassembling it, we had to assemble it back component by component and step by step, and went through a testing session to check whether the components are assembled correctly and can resume its function. At the end of the session, a quiz was conducted with questions related to the session.

## 📝 Reflections
From this lab session, I gained a very valuable experience as I was able to apply the theoretical knowledge I had learned in class and other resources to real-life practices. From removing the wires, power supply, RAM, hard disk, and the cooling fan before reinstalling them back, I learned the proper and foundational techniques for handling PC components safely and correctly. Not only that, this session also strengthen my teamworking skill as me and my groupmates work together on handling the components, towards reaching the session objective. It was also intriguing to see how every piece behind the screen connects and functions together. The quiz conducted at the end of the session further strengthened my understanding of what I have learned. Overall, it was an engaging and insightful experience, and I look forward to more opportunities like this throughout my learning journey.

## 📌 Improvement Suggestions
- Divides the students into a smaller group so that each person has more hands-on opportunities to handle and assemble the PC components.
- Allow a short Q&A session after the quiz to discuss the answers and further reinforce students’ understanding.
