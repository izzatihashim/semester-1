Mr. Yusri's sharing session revolves more on the human behavior aspect, where he shared with us a few advices and experiences that a person must posesses to thrive on the industry. He told us the value of communication and the art of persuading people that a great leader must acquire, as we need to "sell" out our company or work to others. Moreover, he also advised us to not be close-minded and be open, as it will open doors to a lot more unexpected opportunities. He told us we might come across a situation where our work field may not align with what we study, and that's where we must be brave and try to see the opportunity in a new lights, because no one actually knows what lies ahead of us. 

## 📝 Reflections
The whole industry visit has given me a very a huge exposure to the real-world work-life settings, where I can start to vision myself on where I would want myself to be at in the next 3 years. Not only that, I have also gained a lot of valuable knowledge related to my field, especially on the part where the speaker shared about the digital application and development of their company. I learned about the trend in digital transformation, the type of computer and enterprise system used in the company as well as their data process management, all relating to my field of study. Although there are a few topics that are a bit difficult to grasp, due to it being still yet to be covered in our first semester, such as the System Architecture in details and Artificial Inteligence, however being given an early exposure to these topics would help a lot as I progress further into my studies. In addition, the personal skill aspect highlighted by Mr. Yusri was also a very great knowledge and advice that I will sure to take and apply in my life. Nevertheless, it was a well-spent visit and I'm really looking forward for another opportunity like this ahead.
