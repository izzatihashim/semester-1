## 💡 Summary
- **🗣 Speaker:** Tuan Hj. Abdul Alim <br>
- **Topic:** Project Management & System Development <br>
> "System Development is not just a chapter in a textbook. It is the core language of your future career." <br>

This opening quote is enough to fully engross me for the entire session. During the session, Tuan Alim highlighted how Project Management & System Development skill is needed for Data Engineers especially in building a structured data pipeline. He also emphasized on how this skill is crucial as building a project is not just about coding, but the entire process of defining, designing, testing, implementing and maintaining it. <br> <br>
He taught us on how to view this in several different ways, and one of them is by taking cooking Nasi Lemak as an example. You did not just put anything into it, you plan and coordinate what ingredients that you want to put to ensure that your cooking will turn into a Nasi Lemak. By using this example, he also taught us about the Waterfall and Agile methodology. Waterfall is a structured but inflexible method, whereas if in the first place I want to cook Nasi Lemak, then I need to go through the process of cooking it one by one without changing the menu. Meanwhile Agile method is an iterative and flexible method, where the outcome of a project will depends on the situation of it. Let's say in the process of cooking the Nasi Lemak, I suddenly wants to eat white rice but with Ayam Kuah Sambal, then I can easily adapt my plan and change my cooking process to focus on preparing the chicken dish. <br> <br>
Other than that, Tuan Alim also shared about the new era we are advancing into, that is the the Agentic Coding era. He highlighted how using AI is now valued in most company, as it can improve the whole productivity, reduce costs and assist in bulding complex designs. It is not about 100% asking the AI to do everything, but it's leaning towards using AI as an assistant that can do the small and syntax parts while you do the big and hard part such as the architecture and System Design.

## 📝 Reflections
This talk was genuinely an eyes-opening session as I get to learnt about Project Management & System Development in a way that I never had before. The examples that was given by the speaker gave me a very clear understanding of this whole session. Not only that, I also learnt how AI skills has becoming more valuable and essential in the upcoming years. Overall, I will surely apply what I have learnt here into real-life practice to continuosly improve myself and become a successful Data Engineer.  

 ## 📌 Improvement Suggestions
 - Increase the capacity of students that can attend so that students from other programs can also physically attend the session.
- Overall, it was already a great session.
