## 🌟 Reflection of the course
Through this course, I have gained valuable coding skills that will play a major role in my academic journey as a Computer Science student. Starting from the introductory concepts and simple coding tasks and progressing to a more complex programs, I was fully engagged throughout the whole semester as it was a very interesting journey. I can now build my own project using the computing skills that I had learned and will no doubt be able design a bigger project as I advance further into the course. This course has also taught me a few essential skills such as analytical thinking, problem-solving, and logical reasoning. Not only that, It had also developed my ability to work better under pressure especially when I had to code under a short amount of time. Overall, it was a very exciting journey and I hope I can obtain more knowledges in the the future semesters through similar course.
