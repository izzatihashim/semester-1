## 💡 Summary
This assignment required designing a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) calculator using flowcharts. The calculator estimates the energy expended at rest based on user inputs such as age, gender, weight, and height. The solution incorporates branching to select the correct BMR formula for males and females, loops to allow repeated calculations for multiple users, and a user-defined function to modularize the BMR computation. The flowchart clearly shows the input, processing, and output steps, making the process organized and easy to follow.

## 📝 Reflection
Completing this assignment gave me a deeper understanding of how to translate theoretical concepts into practical applications. I learned the importance of branching, which allows the program to make decisions based on user input, and loops, which improve efficiency by enabling repeated calculations without rewriting code. The use of user-defined functions demonstrated how modular design makes a solution more organized. In addition, this assignment helped me realize the value of planning before coding, as creating a detailed flowchart made the steps of the calculation clear and logical. I also developed better problem-solving and analytical skills, since I had to think carefully about the order of operations, handle different scenarios, and consider invalid inputs. Working on this flowchart also strengthened my attention to detail, especially when designing the logic for formulas, loops, and function calls. Overall, this exercise not only improved my understanding of algorithm design but also prepared me for future programming tasks, where clear logic, modular functions, and structured flow need to be applied.
