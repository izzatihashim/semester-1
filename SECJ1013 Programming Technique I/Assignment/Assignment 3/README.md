## 💡 Summary
The last assignment requires students to write a complete C++ program that can assist the telematch committee to determine the winner for an event. A file with the scores are given and students are required to use that file in their program. They also need to produce an output as shown in the example and write it into an output file. This assignment tests the ability of the students to apply the technique of using functions, file operations, arrays and output formatting.

## 📝 Reflection
This assignment has challenged my understanding in applying a few topics that I have learned in class into one complete program. Eventhough those few topics were considered hard for me however by doing this assignment with the help and guidance from my partner has helped me to understanding those topics better. We worked together to make sure our program can run functionally and with a complete precision
