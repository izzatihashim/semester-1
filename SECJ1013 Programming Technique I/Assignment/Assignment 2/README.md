## 💡 Summary
This second assignment uses the same problem statement from before, but making it as a complete program instead. It requires the students to apply their technical programming skill to design the complete coding of the BMR calculator. Examples of input and output of the BMR calculator application was shown as a guide to develop the BMR calculator and students are expected to produce the same output as the example.

## 📝 Reflection
This assignment tested my understanding of the topics learned in class by requiring me to write a complete, functioning C++ program. Working in a pair was very meaningful, as it allowed me to discuss ideas, collaborate on coding, and divide tasks, which helped minimize errors and made the workload more manageable. Through this process, I also learned the importance of teamwork, communication, and reviewing each other’s work to ensure accuracy. Overall, this assignment strengthened my programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and confidence in applying theoretical concepts to practical coding tasks.
