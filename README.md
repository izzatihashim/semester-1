## 🌟 Overall Semester Reflection
The first semester of the whole program serves as huge stepping stone before advancing into more complex semesters throughout the whole program. From solving probability problems, connecting gates and circuits in the lab, programming solution using functions, designing real-world problem's solution, to learning the value of integrity in life, this course has exposed me to a wide variety of topics that will all be channelled into one goal, that is to build a student that can serve back to the community by working in the digital field. Overall, I will make sure to values all the lessons I have learnt this semester as they will no doubt still be required in the future semesters.
