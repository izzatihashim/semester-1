## ⏳ Chronology
**Our problem statement:**
> To enhance an elevator controller system from 2-bit to 3-bit that can support movement between 8 floors of a hotel building, while also enhancing the security system by adding several new features such as PIN-based lock, visitor hotel card detector and opening or closing of door indicator. <br>

- **Stage 1: Getting the solution** <br>
The first stage is about understanding the problem statement and designing the solution for it. This stage require us to use several techniques in Digital Logic which are drawing K-Maps, constructing transition table and deriving Boolean Expression. After the workings are completed, we implemented it in the Deeds Simulator application to generate a complete circuit based on it. It took us several tries to finally gets the final fully functioning circuit after multiple discussions and corrections on our workings, mostly on the K-Maps and table. <br>

- **Stage 2: Writing the report** <br>
Once we are getting the perfect solution and the circuit design of the problem, we then started our report writing for the project. Tasks were distributed equally among team members to ensure everyone gets a decent amount of work to work on. Task distributions are as follows; <br>

| Name | Task
| :--- | :---
| Liyana | Background & Overview, Problem Statement, Improvements
| Farah | System Implementation, Strenghts & Weaknesses
| Nazirah | Acknowledgement, Suggested Solution (Drawings), Achievements
| Najla | Suggested Solution (Explanation), Conclusion

- **Stage 3: Creating the video** <br> 
The last stage of the project is to create a video that explains and concludes what we had obtained so far, primarily referencing to the structure of our report. For our video, we used Canva as our medium of delivering and presenting our contents, each member explaining the topics corresponding to the same distributed task for report writing. We concludes and take the vital points from our reports and write them in a slide presentation form and then explain our findings based on our comprehension and discussions. Our 13 minutes video convers all the essential parts with regard to what have been asked in the instruction rubrics. In addition, we also tried to keep the lengthy video as interesting as possible by using colourful and engaging elements to attract the attention of our audience.

## 📝 Reflections
This project serve as a huge turning point in my learning journey as working in group with one problem statement to obtain one final solution has greatly enhanced my understanding of the whole topic of Counter, Asynchronous Circuit, Flip-flops as well as Logic Simplification. Working on a complicated usage of K-Maps and transition table has developed my attention skill to detail, as no single mistakes can be made on any of the steps to ensure our circuit can function as intended. Needless to say, I became more confident on these topics after finishing this project and it has hugely contributed to my understanding before taking our final exam a week later. Not to mention, the dedication and cooperation of each team member is highly professional and delightful, as everyone made sure to involve themself in the discussion, planning, and basically every part of our project. We had each other's back in completing this project, as mistakes and achievements are soved and celebrated together. In conclusion, this project was an insightful part of my learning progress and I am more than happy to be given a chance to have this kind of project again.

## 📌 Improvement Suggestions
- Organize an acitivy or a session where students' can view each other's work as a method to further enhance and broaden their understanding
