## 💡 Summary
This lab introduces students to Deeds Simulator, a digital circuit simulator designed for learning purposes. In this session, we learned on how to design a digital logic circuits using Deeds Simulator, generate truth tables based on the outputs produced, and create timing diagrams. The lab covers the complete process of building and simulating combinational circuits, including gates, flip-flops, pre-defined circuits, and custom components such as finite state machines. 

## 📝 Reflection
This lab helped me understand how digital circuits are designed and simulated in a practical environment. Using Deeds Simulator, I was able to connect theoretical concepts from lectures to creating a digital circuit from scratch. It also improved my problem-solving and attention-to-detail skills, especially when designing circuits and verifying their behavior. Overall, this experience strengthened both my understanding of digital logic and my confidence in applying it to practical tasks.
