# Lab 3
## 🏢 Details
**Topic**: Synchronous Counter Circuit <br>
**Task**: Build a Synchronous Counter Circuit using Deeds Simulator <br>
**Submission**: 11 January 2026 <br>

## 💡 Summary
The third lab activity for this course expose the students to another hands-on experience, where they need to construct a synchronous counter circuit using elements such as Flip-Flop IC, Basic Gate IC, Breadboard and ETS-5000 Digital Kit. After constructing and running the circuit, students need to record their observation in figures such as state table and state diagram. Based on the observation, a few questions regarding the properties of the circuit can be answered such as the type of counter, indicator for counter and available states. <br>
Aside from the physical circuit construction, students may also construct the circuit virtually using the Deeds simulator application, either to validify the results or to get a clearer understanding on the lab activity.
