# Lab 3
## 🏢 Details
**Topic**: Synchronous Counter Circuit <br>
**Task**: Build a Synchronous Counter Circuit using Deeds Simulator <br>
**Submission**: 11 January 2026 <br>

## 💡 Summary
The third lab activity for this course expose the students to another hands-on experience, where they need to construct a synchronous counter circuit using elements such as Flip-Flop IC, Basic Gate IC, Breadboard and ETS-5000 Digital Kit. After constructing and running the circuit, students need to record their observation in figures such as state table and state diagram. Based on the observation, a few questions regarding the properties of the circuit can be answered such as the type of counter, indicator for counter and available states. Aside from the physical circuit construction, students may also construct the circuit virtually using the Deeds simulator application, either to validify the results or to get a clearer understanding on the lab activity.

## 📝 Reflection
This practical application of building a circuit has helped me understand the topic of counter better. Connecting theoretical knowledge to hands-on activity allows me to view the concept in different ways, where I can polish my understanding on some concepts that may be confusing in slides but actually looks simpler in real life practice. From this activity, it is undeniable that learning indeed needs to matter beyond the classroom as well, since it covers a few concepts that in class learning may not be able to clearly deliver. Nonetheless, both in class and practical learning are essential and complements each other to help me strongly comprehend the knowledge and comprehension of the whole topic.
