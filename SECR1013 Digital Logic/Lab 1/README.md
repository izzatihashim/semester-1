## 💡 Summary
In this lab session, we were briefed about the safety and regulations before starting the lab session as this session requires the handling of electrical components which can be quite harmful if not handled using the correct technique. We were then given several ICs, namely a 7408 Quad 2-input (AND Gate), 7404 Hex Inverter (NOT Gate), 7400 Quad 2-input (NAND Gate), 7432 Quad 2-input (OR Gate), ETS-5000 Digital Training kit, breadboard and wires. Using all these materials, we have to design a complete functioning circuit that can read input(s) and produce output(s) based on it. After completing the circuit, the results are written in truth table form and derive a Boolean Expression based on it, while also asnwering a few other related questions. This session covers mostly about the fundamental concepts of combinational logic gates to strenghten the students' understanding on the basic parts before progressing to a more complex problems and topics. 

## 📝 Reflection
This lab session was a greatly engaging and fun activity, as I was able to work with a real circuit after learning about it during lectures. Buidling the circuit has greatly enhanced my understanding on the topic of Logic Gates and at the end of the session I became more confident to try on solving future related-problems involving logic gates. Not only that, this session also polished my teamworking and analytical skill especially when building the circuit and encountering problems, which require us to work together and think logically on how to solve it. Overall, I hope more lab sessios can be conducted so that I can gain more benefical experiences like this.
