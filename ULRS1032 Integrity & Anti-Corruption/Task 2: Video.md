## 💡 Summary
For our second assignment, we were tasked with creating a Public Service Announcement (PSA) video on our selected topic, “Corruption in Sports." Proper planning and management were crucial to completing this assignment successfully, so we held detailed discussions to develop the storyline, assign actor roles, and plan the shooting setup, including locations and timing. After the planning was finalized, we proceeded to write the script and dialogue for each character to complement the storyline.

Our storyline takes place during a marathon competition, where the main character’s coach asked her to take a “shortcut” with the help of a crew member who has already been bribed during the Marathon event, in order to secure her victory. The video highlights the importance of honesty and integrity and demonstrates the consequences of engaging in unethical behavior.

The shooting process went smoothly, and video editing was completed shortly afterward. Finally, we uploaded the video to YouTube to share it with others and raise awareness about corruption in sports.

## 📝 Reflections
I had a lot of fun during the completion of this assignment as it involves many fun activities and elements, a different approach to learning about this course. For this assignment, I took the role of one of the Marathon crew member, took part on the shooting of the video and also the editing of the video. Me and my other groupmate, Nazirah collaborated together into finishing the editing of the video. I learned the skills of editing, collaborating as well as communication and teamworking skills with my other groupmates through the whole process of creating the video. Not only that, I also gained a lot of valuable information by watching other groups' videos which were very information and engaging. I believe this type of assignment is highly beneficial as it effectively raises awareness both among students and the public.

## 📌 Improvement Suggestions
- Organize a class or activity session where students can watch each others' videos and discuss about it.
