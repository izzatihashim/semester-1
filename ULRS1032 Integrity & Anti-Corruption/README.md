## 🌟 Reflection of the course
What this course taught me was the importance of integrity and ethics in shaping an individual’s identity. Having strong academic abilities and excellent soft skills does not define true success if one lacks moral values. Through this course, I also gained greater exposure to current issues and relationship challenges within today’s community that need to be addressed and prevented. In other words, I aspire to become someone who can guide and influence others to do the right things by serving and contributing to the community through leadership and by spreading awareness using various platforms. These are the values and approaches emphasized throughout this course. By the end of the course, I gained a deeper understanding of why this subject is introduced to students, and I hope to apply what I have learned in my life to positively shape both the community and myself.
