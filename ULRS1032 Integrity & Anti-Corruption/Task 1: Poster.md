## 💡 Summary
For our first assignment, we were tasked to propose an idea based on a chosen topic related to different forms of corruption occurring in our country. Our group selected the topic “Corruption in Sports” to provide better exposure and awareness to the public regarding this issue.
The first step in designing the poster was to collect responses from students through an online survey created using Google Forms. The purpose of the survey was to assess students’ level of awareness regarding corruption in the sports industry, its effects, and the actions that should be taken to combat this issue.<br><br>

Our poster covers several subtopics, including the background of corruption in sports, case chronology, methodology, objectives, concepts of integrity and corruption, comparisons between local and global cases, research findings, conclusions, and suggestions to eradicate corruption in sports. The findings from the survey were also incorporated to support and enhance the content of the poster.
