## 💡 Summary
For our first assignment, we were tasked to propose an idea based on a chosen topic related to different forms of corruption occurring in our country. Our group selected the topic “Corruption in Sports” to provide better exposure and awareness to the public regarding this issue.
The first step in designing the poster was to collect responses from students through an online survey created using Google Forms. The purpose of the survey was to assess students’ level of awareness regarding corruption in the sports industry, its effects, and the actions that should be taken to combat this issue.<br>

Our poster covers several subtopics, including the background of corruption in sports, case chronology, methodology, objectives, concepts of integrity and corruption, comparisons between local and global cases, research findings, conclusions, and suggestions to eradicate corruption in sports. The findings from the survey were also incorporated to support and enhance the content of the poster. After designing the poster, we presented our poster to the whole class to explain and help them understand the topic that we had highlighted in the poster.

## 📝 Reflections
At the end of the assessment, I was able to gain a deeper understanding and acquire new knowledge about this relevant topic through the creative and engaging use of media, which made the content easier to read and comprehend. By sharing and presenting our poster to others, we believe that more people, including the public, will become aware of the different forms of corruption occurring in our country and understand the importance of taking action to prevent such issues from continuing to harm our nation. Additionally, reading the work of other groups provided me with valuable new insights. I believe this method of assessment is highly effective and should continue to be included as part of the course evaluation.

## 📌 Improvement Suggestions
- Organize an interactive activity, such as a Gallery Walk, where students can view each other’s posters and ask questions directly to the presenters about their work.
