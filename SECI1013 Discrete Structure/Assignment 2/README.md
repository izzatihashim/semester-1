## 💡 Summary
This second assignment covers the second topic of this course, and we were required to solve 7 topic-related questions. The questions were centered around the application of relational concept into determining a type of relation, working with function equation and determing its type, and building and tracing an algorithm for a relation. We uses the same approaches and discussed our answers after completing it. We were able to came out with the best solution after a thorough discussion by identifying any issues, refering to lecture's notes and combining our ideas.

## 📝 Reflection
From this assignment, I received a better understanding on how to apply what I had learned during lectures into solving exam-like questions. Eventhough we had been introduced to this topic since high school, there are still a lot to learn in ensuring we fully understood and be able to solve the problems exactly like how the questions asked. The topic of recurrence & recursive relations might be the most trickiest subtopic, as the questions usually require the skill of critical thinking and problem-solving skill. However through discussion, we managed to help on each other's understanding and solve the problem correctly.
