## 💡 Summary
This assignment covers the first topic in this course, whereas we were tasked to create a detailed solution for 6 topic-related questions. The questions cover the calculation of sets, proving sets using laws, applying the union principle, working with logical propositions, using truth tables to prove logically equivalent propositions, and the direct proofing method. To ensure that everyone fully understands the topic, we agreed on trying to solve all the questions by ourselves first before discussing it. During our discussion, we discussed our answer and come out with the most detailed and correct solution for each question. 

## 📝 Reflection
This assignment stregthen my overall understanding of the Set Theory & Logic topic especially during discussion with group members and consultation with the lecturer. I was able to ask questions, share my opinions, and help others understand the concepts. I also learned the importance of being careful and detailed especially when doing proving problems. Solving questions with long problem statement further enhanced my analytical skill and critical thinking when identifying the key elements and designing the solution of the problem. By the end of the assignment, I feel confident to answer more questions related to this topic especially as it was asked during the mid semester examination.
